# The-Probability-Drive
It Give probability of any event , but the problem is that  the probability is random ....... 
# What it is?
It is a small application made by me just for fun 
It simply takes in a event , do some maths and shows you a totally random probability 
> This is a good way of wasting time , thats why i made it . Some of its feature are - 
> * Total waste of time
> * Sometimes shows good result which makes you positive
> * Sometimes shows bad result which makes you just sad [ahh life].....
## A challenge 
> This is a challenge just 4 u ;-]
Just try finding probability of output of my probability drive .
#### Imagine using probability to find probability of probably random event which nobody cares about......
#### In case of bugs , either pull of a issue on github or u can use insect repellent too....

# AGAIN I AM SAYING THIS IS JUST 4 FUN , RESULTS ARE COMPLETELY RANDOM

Also a bit of side note - 
> U can find ur history in ur documents folders

# ENJOY!
